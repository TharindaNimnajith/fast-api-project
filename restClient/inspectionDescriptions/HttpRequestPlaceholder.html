Reports a <code>$placeholder</code> inside a request. 
<p>A <code>$placeholder</code> to be replaced by the user is created automatically when a tool cannot recognize a part of a request. For example, a request mapping <code>/aaaa/*/bbb</code> will be generated as <code>GET localhost/aaaa/{{$placeholder}}/bbb</code>.
